# CD: User Interface Part 2
Client Deliverable - User Interface - Part 2  is a full UI built in Visual Studio with Bootstrap

For this Client Deliverable, you will need to create ALL of the screens for your entire system.  **NOTE that requires a lot of planning and ITERATIVE work to have a quality, well designed UI.  The more work you do now on UI means substantially less rework for Capstone 2.  All of the CSS and Bootstrap homework assignments should be very helpful to you in completing this CD.**

Part 2 is a full UI built in Visual Studio with Bootstrap.  Your UI needs to be put onto the servers you have used in CIS 3342.  You will demo for class and the clients from here.  You will also give your client access to this so that they can work with the screens.

Everyone looks at UI differently, and UI collaboration takes on many different forms.  However, it is mandatory that all team members fully participate in the UI development and that the UI is consistent across all screens.  Screen designs should be done professionally and all menu options, navigation, fields, flow need to be shown appropriately.  The screens should be displayed in a prototype format, where you can navigate from screen to screen.  The screen design and flow need to be clear and consistent.  Everything from your user stories, use cases and data model must be on your screens!   


**For CD7 P2 - these screens are not just mock-ups in photoshop or something similar.**  They must be built in Visual Studio with Bootstrap, so that all you have to do next semester is start coding on the pages you have created.   Screens MUST use Responsive Design techniques.   You do not have the time in Capstone 2 to rebuild your entire UI, this is the UI that you will use next semester.

You need to follow Temple’s web style guide.  The current version is posted on Canvas.

***You also need to include text that defines the flow of the user experience. 
For example:
The x user will use this screen to do A – B – C - after completion of this they will then be able to XXXX and run the XXXX report.***

If your system requires any other types of interfaces from other systems, these must also be included.
