# CD: User Interface Part 2
Client Deliverable - User Interface - Part 2  is a full UI built in Visual Studio with Bootstrap

For this Client Deliverable, you will need to create ALL of the screens for your entire system.  **NOTE that requires a lot of planning and ITERATIVE work to have a quality, well designed UI.  The more work you do now on UI means substantially less rework for Capstone 2.  All of the CSS and Bootstrap homework assignments should be very helpful to you in completing this CD.**

Everyone looks at UI differently, and UI collaboration takes on many different forms.  However, it is mandatory that all team members fully participate in the UI development and that the UI is consistent across all screens.  Screen designs should be done professionally and all menu options, navigation, fields, flow need to be shown appropriately.  The screens should be displayed in a prototype format, where you can navigate from screen to screen.  The screen design and flow need to be clear and consistent.  Everything from your user stories, use cases and data model must be on your screens!   

**These screens are not just mock-ups in photoshop or something similar.**  They must be built in Visual Studio with Bootstrap, so that all you have to do next semester is start coding on the pages you have created.   Screens MUST use Responsive Design techniques.   You do not have the time in Capstone 2 to rebuild your entire UI, this is the UI that you will use next semester. If your system requires any other types of interfaces from other systems, these must also be included.

You will demo your interface to the class.  You will also give your client access  so that they can try the interface.

In your Canvas submission, you will submit a screenshot of all screen with text that defines the flow of the user experience (think: user stories). 
***For example:
The x user will use this screen to do A – B – C - after completion of this they will then be able to XXXX and run the XXXX report.***


# What to do

***Setup***
- Create a git repo using the GitHub Classroom link in Canvas. 
    - Lock master branch  (see previous Git homework)
    - Set ***minimum commit reviewer to 2***
    - Click ***Include Administator***
- Clone the repo locally with the command line or GitHub Desktop.
- Create and swittch to a new git branch called _project setup_
- Create a new Web ASP.NET Visual Studio 2017 project in this directory
    - Click Browse to change Location of the project to the local git repository
    - Change project location to your local git repo
    - Check "Create directory for solution" (We understand that this is different from what you may do/have done in 3342, but this is related to the capstone 2 servers.  Trust me....you do not want to miss these important steps!)
    - Click Ok to create the project
- Create a master page. 
- Commit, push and create a new Pull Request. 
    - ask two teamates to review your PR. 
    - Merge
        
***Build a full UI in Visual Studio with Bootstrap.*** 
- For each new screen:
    - Create a GitHub Pull Request in the PR description include:  
        - The mockup UI image from part 1 of the CD. 
        - Most relevant user strories for this UI. 
    - Two reviewers have to review  the code before it is merge to master. 
     
***Deploy and report***   
- Deploy the UI on the servers you have used in CIS 3342. 
- Compile the report to be included in the final book and to be submitted in Canvas.
